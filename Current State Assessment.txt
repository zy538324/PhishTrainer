Current State Assessment
Your foundation is solid with ASP.NET Core backend and basic multi-tenancy support, but the project is in early stages with several critical gaps for enterprise MSP deployment.

Critical Missing Components
Security & Authentication
Authentication System: No JWT/OAuth2 implementation visible in the codebase

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Missing granular permissions (MSP Admin, Tenant Admin, End User, Auditor roles)

Audit Logging: No comprehensive security event tracking for compliance

Two-Factor Authentication: Critical for MSP admin access

Email Infrastructure
Email Delivery Service: Current MailService needs production-grade SMTP pool with failover

Email Queue System: Missing reliable background job processing (consider Hangfire or Azure Service Bus)

Sender Reputation Monitoring: No tracking of blacklist status or deliverability metrics

Campaign Management
Template Library: No pre-built professional phishing templates (categorized by difficulty/industry)

A/B Testing: Missing capability to test template effectiveness

Scheduling System: No timezone-aware campaign scheduling

Difficulty Progression: No adaptive difficulty based on user performance

Automated Remediation: Missing automatic training assignment for failed users

Analytics & Reporting
Dashboard: No visual analytics for click rates, credential submissions, reporting rates

Comparative Analytics: Missing industry benchmarking and tenant-to-tenant comparisons

Executive Reports: No PDF/Excel export with customizable branding

Risk Scoring: No user-level or department-level vulnerability scoring

Trend Analysis: Missing historical performance tracking

Real-time Metrics: No WebSocket/SignalR for live campaign monitoring

Training Content
Learning Management System: No integrated training modules for failed users

Video Content: Missing educational content delivery

Certification Tracking: No completion certificates or compliance proof

Microlearning: Missing bite-sized training snippets

Gamification: No badges, leaderboards, or achievement system

Multi-Tenancy Enhancements
Tenant Isolation: Database-level isolation needs verification (consider row-level security)

Resource Quotas: No limits on campaigns, users, or email volume per tenant

White-Labeling: Missing custom branding, domains, and CSS theming

Tenant Provisioning: No self-service onboarding workflow

Billing Integration: No usage tracking or Stripe/payment gateway integration

Integration Capabilities
SCIM/LDAP Sync: No Active Directory or Azure AD user import

SIEM Integration: Missing webhook support for security platforms

API Documentation: No OpenAPI/Swagger comprehensive docs

Webhook System: No event notifications for external systems

SSO Support: Missing SAML/OIDC for enterprise authentication

Infrastructure & DevOps
CI/CD Pipeline: No GitHub Actions workflows visible

Docker Deployment: Missing Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations

Health Checks: No endpoint monitoring or dependency health validation

Logging: No structured logging (Serilog) or centralized log aggregation

Monitoring: Missing Application Insights or Prometheus metrics

Backup Strategy: No automated database backup procedures

Frontend Gaps
Modern Framework: Plain HTML/CSS needs upgrade to React/Vue/Angular with TypeScript

Responsive Design: Mobile-first design for on-the-go management

Data Tables: No advanced filtering, sorting, pagination components

Template Editor: Missing WYSIWYG email/landing page builder

User Management UI: No bulk import/export interfaces

Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 compliance not evident

Compliance & Legal
Data Privacy: No GDPR/CCPA data retention policies

Consent Management: Missing opt-in/opt-out mechanisms

Data Export: No user data portability features

Terms of Service: Missing legal framework for simulated attacks

Ethical Guidelines: No clear policy documentation for responsible use
